------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program was written to analyse network packets or PCAP files for incidents such as scans or unencrypted credentials. I consulted Scapy documentation, our class Piazza, and stack overflow to write this code. Starter code was written by Ming Chow. This program was tested using given sample pcap files taken from various sources (including DEFCON) and sample pcaps from the Wireshark wiki.

Dependencies:
Scapy
